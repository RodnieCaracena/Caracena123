                <br>
                Definition: Treecko is cool, calm, and collected - it never panics under any situation. If a bigger foe
                were to glare at this Pokémon, it would glare right back without conceding an inch of ground.

                <br>
                Definition: The leaves growing out of Grovyle's body are convenient for camouflaging it from enemies in
                the forest. This Pokémon is a master at climbing trees in jungles.

                <br>
                Definition: Sceptile has seeds growing on its back. They are said to be bursting with nutrients that
                revitalize trees. This Pokémon raises the trees in a forest with loving care.
