        <tr>
            <td>
                <strong>Squirtle</strong>
                <br>
                <img class="pokemon-image" src="pokemons\squirtle-removebg-preview.png" alt="Squirtle Image">
                <br>
                Definition: Squirtle's shell is not merely used for protection. The shell's rounded shape and the
                grooves on its surface help minimize resistance in water, enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.
            </td>
            <td>
                <strong>Wartortle</strong>

                <img class="pokemon-image" src="pokemons\wartortle-fotor-bg-remover-2023112301420.png" alt="Wartortle Image">
                <br>
                Definition: Wartortle's tail is large and covered with a rich, thick fur. The tail becomes increasingly
                deeper in color as Wartortle ages. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon's toughness
                as a battler.

                <strong>Blastoise</strong>

                <img class="pokemon-image" src="pokemons\blastoise-fotor-bg-remover-20231123090.png" alt="Blastoise Image">
                <br>
                Definition: Blastoise has water spouts that protrude from its shell. The water spouts are very accurate.
                They can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy to strike empty cans from a distance of over 160
                feet.
