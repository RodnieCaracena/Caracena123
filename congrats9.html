                <br>
                Definition: Mudkip uses the sensitive fin on its head to take radar readings of its surroundings. In a pinch, it can brandish enough power to crush rocks.
            </td>

                <strong>Marshtomp</strong>

                <img class="pokemon-image" src="pokemons\mashtomp-fotor-bg-remover-2023112301141.png" alt="Marshtomp Image">
                <br>
                Definition: Marshtomp is much faster at traveling through mud than it is at swimming. This Pokémon's hindquarters exhibit obvious development, giving it the ability to walk on just its hind legs.
            </td>
            <td>
                <strong>Swampert</strong>

                <img class="pokemon-image" src="pokemons\swampert-fotor-bg-remover-2023112301114.png" alt="Swampert Image">
                <br>
                Definition: Swampert is very strong. It has enough power to easily drag a boulder weighing more than a ton. This Pokémon also has powerful vision that lets it see even in murky water.
